# A simple calculator application

This is a simple command line calculator. Coupled with the feature
of most terminals to recall history of previous commands and edit
the line, it speeds doing many similar calculations.

'calc' also uses the RPN notation as it is efficient and saves keystrokes.
For more information on RPN see 
<a href="http://www.calculator.org/rpn.aspx">RPN notation history</a>.

It contains the most used trigonometric and scientific functions, plus
some predefined scientific constants. Try 'calc -help' for a list of
what is implemented.

The original 'calc' program was a command line implementation in C
of an RPN calculator, because I liked my HP-41CV.
Also, UNIX and DOS platforms didn't have all the nice
utilities that are now available with simple command line up arrow
or tcsh ^P for recalling the last command for edits.


Additionally, I was a FORTRAN programmer learning C. I dug this out while
rearranging files and thought it would be a little window into the past.
