A simple calculator application. The original was a command line
implementation in C of an RPN calculator, because I liked my
HP-41CV. Also, UNIX and DOS platforms didn't have all the nice
utilities that are now available with simple command line up arrow
or tcsh ^P for recalling the last command for edits.
 For more information on RPN see 
<a href="http://www.calculator.org/rpn.aspx">RPN notation history</a>.
I also was a FORTRAN programmer learning C.

So now, why not create simple calculators using other tools and languages?
